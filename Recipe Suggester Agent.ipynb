I'll stand in front of my open fridge for like 10 minutes, staring at random ingredients, trying to remember if I can even eat half of them (shellfish allergy, hate mushrooms). Then I spend another 15 minutes scrolling through recipe sites that don't match what I actually have at home.\n\nSo I built this agent to solve my own problem. You just tell it what's in your fridge - eggs, cheese, some sad tomatoes, whatever - and it suggests 3 recipes you can actually make right now. The cool part is it remembers your dietary restrictions. I'm pescatarian and allergic to shellfish, so it won't suggest shrimp stir-fry even if I have all the ingredients.\n\nThe agent uses Gemini to understand what you're working with and come up with ideas that make sense. It's not just throwing random recipes at you - it actually considers what goes together and what you can realistically cook. Plus it finds recipe links for you, so you don't have to Google \"chicken bell pepper recipe\" and scroll through 50 blog posts about someone's vacation before getting to the actual instructions.\n\nIt's simple but it works. Saves me probably 20-30 minutes every day and I waste way less food now. Been using it for quick lunches and weeknight dinners mostly.\n\n## Architecture & Features\n\nBasic setup: you input ingredients → Gemini processes with your saved preferences (allergies, dislikes, diet) → outputs 3 recipe suggestions → optional recipe link lookup.\n\nThree main components working together:\n- **LLM Agent (Gemini 2.0)**: Does the actual recipe thinking\n- **Memory**: Stores your food preferences so you don't repeat yourself\n- **Session management**: Keeps conversation context if you want multiple suggestions\n\nAlso added a recipe link finder that searches for actual URLs. Works pretty well most of the time, if not you will be redirected to a simple google research of your recipe.\n\n## Tech\nGemini 2.0 Flash API, Python, simple in-memory storage for the demo.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# What Should I Eat?
